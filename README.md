# YobaLoncher
YobaLÃ¶ncher - YetanOthernotreallyBeautifulnorAdmirable Launcher

The current version is just a backup. No documentation will be provided until a proper release. Use this on your own risk or to fork a pretty simple WinForms launcher.

**Features:**
- Launching the game from folder or via Steam
- MD5 check of the given filelist for further update
- Self-update
- CuStOm DeSiGn
- Localization files
- Players can install your Mods / Add-ons / whatever you name it
- Offline mode (or, more like, diagnostic mode, since the only function the loncher will serve then is the filecheck)
- File backup

**TODO:**
- Git: settings sample

**Dev Requirements:**
They're not included, yet to build the launcher you'd need:
- Costura Fody (latest, which implies VS 2019)
- Newtonsoft Json
