# YobaLoncher
YobaLÃ¶ncher - YetanOthernotreallyBeautifulnorAdmirable Launcher

The current version is just a backup. No documentation will be provided until a proper release. Use this on your own risk or to fork a pretty simple WinForms launcher.

**Features:**
- Launching the game from folder or via Steam
- MD5 check of the given filelist for further update
- Self-update
- CuStOm DeSiGn
- Offline mode (or, more like, diagnostic mode, since the only function the loncher will serve then is the filecheck)

**TODO:**
- File check summary and the ability to deselect the optional files
- Localization file
- Git: settings sample
- Better folder selection dialog

**Dev Requirements:**
They're not included, yet to build the launcher you'd need:
- Awesomium NetWrapper Unofficial fix 1.7.5.01
- Costura Fody 3.3.3 or later (and, therefore, Fody 4.2.1 or later)
- Newtonsoft Json 12.0.3
